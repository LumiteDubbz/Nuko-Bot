# Nuko

Nuko is a Discord bot for community management, written in C# using the Discord.Net library on .NET Core 3.0. It features lots of moderation commands in a customisable fashion.

It also has a large section for point managing based on rounds achieved for Maycrom's [BTDB Overhaul Mod](), but it can be used for any Bloons mod.
