# Archive notice
This project, along with all of my other Discord-related projects have been **archived**.

This means:
- The code **will** stay public.
- The code **can** be forked and cloned like usual.
- I, personally, will **not** be updating this code for any reason, including security patches.

This is because:
- I have quit Discord.
- I have no interest in returning to Discord.
- I still want these projects to exist for other people to use and as a catalogue of my old work.

A Discord bot for community management, written in C# using the Discord.Net library.</center>

Nuko features lots of moderation commands in a customisable fashion. It also has a large section for point managing based on rounds achieved for Maycrom's BTDB Overhaul Mod, but it can be used for any Bloons mod or disabled entirely.
